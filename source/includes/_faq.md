# Frequently Asked Questions

## Multiple scenes

> In `src/scenes.js`, add the scenes you would like to load like this:

```
require("scenes/MyTestScene");
require("scenes/AnotherTestScene");

```

> and start the frontend without the '-s' parameters

```
node start frontend
```

<aside class="notice">You can load as many scenes as you want and toggle the scenes using the numblock numeric digit keys (e.g. press 2 to toggle second scene).</aside>
